# E-tendering
Tendering made simple, E-tendering is a Blockchain application designed using Ethereum Platform, this code is written using solidity language
In Tender system the data can be manipulated by the agencies and the bidding amount may be leaked to other companies
This is an application that hides the visibility of the bids and the least bid is taken as the tender by the system itself
This application keeps the data private and all the extortion is eliminated.
Open Ethereum online and copy the code of this project and paste it by creating four different files in it as shown in the word document
Now deploy the project entering the bidding amount, the least bid is taken as the tender automatically by the system.
